# **1️⃣ Problem Statement**

**Context:**
Developers face a massive challenge in discovering high-quality open-source projects on platforms like GitHub:

* Millions of repositories exist, but most search methods focus on popularity (stars/forks) rather than **quality, relevance, or innovative approach**.
* Smaller or niche projects often get overlooked, even if they are technically impressive.
* Developers waste time sifting through repositories that may have poor maintenance, weak code structure, or inactive communities.

**Impact:**

* High-quality projects remain undiscovered.
* Contributors struggle to find beginner-friendly or innovative projects.
* OSS growth and knowledge transfer are slowed.

**Key Insight:**
A repository’s **value is multi-dimensional** — it’s not just popularity. Metrics like maintenance, code quality, approach to the problem, community, and documentation all matter.

# **2️⃣ High-Level Solution Overview**

We propose a **scored discoverability engine** that:

1. **Aggregates data from GitHub** (or similar APIs) about repositories.
2. **Analyzes each repository across four main categories**, each scored out of 10 based on weighted criteria.
3. **Ranks repositories** based on combined scores to surface top projects and “special mentions.”
4. Optionally, uses **LLMs** to generate summaries or evaluate nuanced aspects like problem-solving approach.

This approach ensures that repositories are evaluated **holistically** rather than purely on stars or popularity.

---

# **3️⃣ Four-Category Scoring System**

Each category is **out of 10**, with multiple weighted criteria.

---

### **Category 1: Maintenance & Activity**

**Goal:** Measure how actively maintained and healthy the project is.
**Criteria & Weight Examples:**

* **Commit frequency & recency (40%)** → active vs abandoned.
* **PR merge rate (30%)** → responsiveness to contributions.
* **Issue resolution rate (20%)** → efficiency in handling bugs/features.
* **CI/tests presence (10%)** → ensures stability and professional workflow.

**Rationale:** Projects that are maintained actively are more reliable and likely easier to contribute to.

---

### **Category 2: Code Quality & Approach**

**Goal:** Evaluate how well the repository solves its problem.
**Criteria & Weight Examples:**

* **Code structure & modularity (40%)** → clean architecture.
* **Algorithmic efficiency / cleverness (30%)** → innovative solutions.
* **Uniqueness / problem-solving approach (20%)** → novel implementations.
* **Readability & inline documentation (10%)** → maintainability.

**Rationale:** A technically strong project with clever problem-solving stands out, even if less popular.

---

### **Category 3: Community & Collaboration**

**Goal:** Assess the health and engagement of the contributor community.
**Criteria & Weight Examples:**

* **Contributor count & diversity (50%)** → robust collaboration.
* **PR review and discussion quality (25%)** → active and constructive feedback.
* **Issue responsiveness (25%)** → timely replies to questions/bugs.

**Rationale:** A strong community increases project longevity and improves the contributor experience.

---

### **Category 4: Documentation & Usability**

**Goal:** Measure how easy it is to get started and understand the project.
**Criteria & Weight Examples:**

* **Readme clarity (40%)** → concise, understandable description.
* **Examples / tutorials (30%)** → quick start for new contributors.
* **Setup instructions (20%)** → smooth installation/configuration.
* **License & contribution guidelines (10%)** → ensures legal clarity and easier contributions.

**Rationale:** Good documentation makes projects approachable and lowers the barrier to contribution.

---

# **4️⃣ Ranking & Display Logic**

1. **Calculate category scores** using weighted criteria.
2. **Compute overall score** = weighted sum or average of four categories.
3. **Top Highlights:** Repositories excelling in all four categories.
4. **Special Mentions:** Repositories strong in some areas (e.g., exceptional code or approach) but weaker in others (like documentation).

**Display:**

* Card-based UI showing:

  * Repo name & description
  * Scores per category
  * Overall score
  * Tags like “Special Mention: Great Code, Weak Docs”

**Optional:** Use LLM summaries for top repos to highlight **why they are exciting or innovative**.

---

# **5️⃣ Two-Stage Filtering (Optional Optimization)**

To handle scale efficiently:

1. **Stage 1:** Broad filtering using **objective metrics** (maintenance, activity, community) to reduce thousands of repos to ~50.
2. **Stage 2:** Deep ranking using **LLMs or code analysis** to evaluate algorithm quality, problem-solving approach, and cleverness.

This reduces **compute/API load** while still ranking projects by approach quality.

# **6️⃣ Benefits of This Approach**

| Aspect                         | Why It’s Better                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Holistic evaluation            | Accounts for maintenance, code, community, and documentation.           |
| Balances popularity vs quality | Small but brilliant projects can surface.                               |
| Transparent & explainable      | Each category score is clear; judges and users can understand rankings. |
| Hackathon-friendly             | Stage 1 is lightweight, stage 2 adds wow-factor with LLMs.              |
| Special mentions               | Recognizes niche strengths even if a repo isn’t perfect.                |

# **7️⃣ How It Solves the Problem**

* Developers find **high-quality, relevant, and innovative projects** quickly.
* Niche repositories are **not overlooked** due to low stars.
* Contribution is **simpler and faster** thanks to clear filtering, ranking, and optional summaries.
* Provides **actionable insights**: users see strengths and weaknesses of projects before diving in.

---

# **8️⃣ Key Considerations for Team Members**

* **Backend:**

  * Fetch GitHub repo data via API (REST or GraphQL).
  * Compute category scores and overall ranking.
  * Cache results for performance.

* **Frontend:**

  * Simple card layout showing scores, tags, and links.
  * Filters for language, topics, and beginner-friendly issues.

* **Optional LLM:**

  * Summarize top repos or special mentions.
  * Evaluate qualitative aspects like problem-solving approach.

* **MVP for Hackathon:**

  * Stage 1 filtering + category scoring + card display.
  * Stage 2 LLM ranking as bonus for top 5 repos.
